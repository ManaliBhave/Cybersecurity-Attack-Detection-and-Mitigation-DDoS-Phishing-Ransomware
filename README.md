# Cybersecurity-Attack-Detection-and-Mitigation-DDoS-Phishing-Ransomware

Simulated Attack, Detection, and Mitigation of DDoS, Phishing and Ransomware Attacks showcasing expertise in Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. 
Orchestrated a simulated attack environment, leveraging Mininet for traffic generation and RYU controller for traffic management within an SDN architecture. Employed the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to achieve an impressive 96.34% accuracy in DDoS attack detection.
Innovated a browser extension equipped with a highly accurate Machine Learning model, achieving a remarkable 98.76% accuracy in identifying phishing websites, utilizing the powerful Gradient Boosting Algorithm. This extension was further enhanced by integrating the QuantStart web analytics tool, which facilitated the detection of phishing websites even with HTTPS connections.
Implemented an innovative honeycomb approach for Ransomware detection, effectively by using trap files and identify the malware. Implemented backup and quarantine functionalities.
